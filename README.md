# MIIRAGE - Democratize Augmented Reality

*An Augmented Reality NFT Client + Marketplace*

#### PLEASE NOTE:
This an a proof-of-concept build. The design, implementation, & architecture expressed in this repo is limited to the scope of a PoC. An overhaul to native platforms is coming soon.

## Architectural Approach

### Client

The PoC client is a web-based React application bootstrapped from `create-react-app`. It will be deployed to Arweave per their documentation [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-deploy).
